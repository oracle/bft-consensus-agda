    {- TUTORIAL: A simple proof using the branching support for AST MaybeExtOps, specifically BCif.

    If we start with

      branchingProgWP i = ?

    As seen after C-c C-l, or by doing C-u C-c C- in the hole, the goal is of type:

      ASTPredTrans.predTrans MaybePTExt branchingProg bpPost i

    Using C-c C-, (without the C-u prefix), tells us a bit more
    detail about the goal:

      ASTPredTrans.opPT MaybePTExt (right (BCif ⌊ n ≟ℕ 0 ⌋))
        (λ x →
           ASTPredTrans.predTrans MaybePTExt
           ((λ { (lift false) → ASTreturn (2 * n)
               ; (lift true) → ASTop (Left Maybe-bail) (λ ())
               })
            x))
        bpPost i

    This is because branchingProg starts with an ASTop (see ASTPredTrans.predTrans (ASTop c f)).
    It's still not very easy to see what needs to be proved.  Doing C-u C-u C-c C-, in the hole goes
    further, revealing the following:

      Σ
        (isYes
         (map′ (≡ᵇ⇒≡ n 0) (≡⇒≡ᵇ n 0) (Data.Bool.Properties.T? (n ≡ᵇ 0)))
         ≡ true →
         n ≡ 0)
        (λ x →
           isYes
           (map′ (≡ᵇ⇒≡ n 0) (≡⇒≡ᵇ n 0) (Data.Bool.Properties.T? (n ≡ᵇ 0)))
           ≡ false →
           Σ (1 ≤ n) (λ x₁ → n + (n + 0) ≡ n + (n + 0)))

    We can see that this is a product, and that each conjunct receives evidence that the condition
    evaluates to the relevant boolean value (true for the first, false for the second).  This is
    because

      ASTPredTrans.opPT BranchPT (right (BCif c)) f P i

    requires two proofs, one for when the condition c is true and one for when it's false; each case
    gets evidence that the condition evaluates to the relevant boolean.

    Furthermore, we can see that the goals for each conjunct are now derived from the postcondition,
    bpPost.  Now we can start to see what we need to prove.

    The second conjunct does not depend on the first, so we can separate into two goals:

      proj₁ (branchingProgWP _) = ?
      proj₂ (branchingProgWP _) = ?

    Using C-c C-, in the first hole gives us this goal:

      ⌊ n ≟ℕ 0 ⌋ ≡ true → n ≡ 0

    This can be dispatched with toWitnessT:

      proj₁ (branchingProgWP _) = toWitnessT

    Equivalently, let's give the evidence that ⌊ n ≟ℕ 0 ⌋ ≡ true a name for consistency with the
    false case below:

      proj₁ (branchingProgWP _) isTrue = toWitnessT isTrue

    The second conjunct is similar.  Doing C-c C-, in the hole shows:

      ⌊ n ≟ℕ 0 ⌋ ≡ false → 0 < n × n + (n + zero) ≡ n + (n + zero)

    Let's give the evidence that the condition is false a name, so we can
    prove the two conjuncts separately:

      proj₂ (branchingProgWP _) isFalse = ?

    The goal shown by C-c C-, is now:

      0 < n × n + (n + zero) ≡ n + (n + zero)

    We can do C-c C-r to refine this to two separate goals, the first of which is 0 < n.  Again, we
    use the relevant toWitness function (toWitnessF because the condition is false), along with a
    library function n≢0⇒n>0 to fill the hole for the first conjunct.

      proj₂ (branchingProgWP _) isFalse = (n≢0⇒n>0 (toWitnessF isFalse)) , ?

    C-c C-, shows that the second hole needs evidence that n + (n + zero) ≡ n + (n + zero), which is
    easily satisfied by refl, resulting in the complete proof below.

    One important lesson is to remember to use the variants of C-c C-, with zero, one or two C-u's
    before it.  Each is the most useful of the three in some contexts.  Experienced users might
    predict which one is best, but just having enough experience to remember to try all three is a
    big help.
