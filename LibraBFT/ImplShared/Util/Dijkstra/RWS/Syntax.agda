-- Lens functionality
--
-- If we make RWS work for different level State types, we will break use and
-- modify because Lens does not support different levels, we define use and
-- modify' here for RoundManager. We are ok as long as we can keep
-- RoundManager in Set. If we ever need to make RoundManager at some higher
-- Level, we will have to consider making Lens level-agnostic. Preliminary
-- exploration by @cwjnkins showed this to be somewhat painful in particular
-- around composition, so we are not pursuing it for now.
