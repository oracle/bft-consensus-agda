-- about it, and how Votes and Blocks are signed.

  -- We do not yet have sufficient support to model precisely the hashing used in the Haskell code,
  -- so it is better that we postulate its intended properties to ensure proofs have the desired
  -- properties available.  Note that a simpler injectivity property such as

  -- hashBD-inj' : ∀ {bd1} {bd2}
  --             → hashBD bd1 ≡ hashBD bd2
  --             → NonInjective-≡ sha256
  --             ⊎ bd1 ≡L bd2
  --
  -- does *not* hold because the input to the hash function used in hashBD does *not* include all
  -- components of the BlockData being hashed.

  -- TODO-2: Similarly express other hashing functions and their intended injectivity properties where
  -- the Agda implementation does not accurately reflect the Haskell implementation.

  -- TODO-2: Enable support for the hashS function we use in the Haskell code, which hashes tuples
  -- of serializable types), and then define hashBD using this and prove that it ensures hashBD-inj.

  -- The Haskell implementation includes "HashTag"s when hashing in order to ensure that it is not
  -- possible (modulo hash collisions) for the encodings of two values of different types (e.g.,
  -- Vote and Block) to yield the same bitstring and thus the same hash (and therefore potentially
  -- the same signature, where hashes are signed).  For example, the Haskell hashLI function is:
  --
  -- hashLI :: LedgerInfo -> HashValue
  -- hashLI (LedgerInfo commitInfo (HashValue consensusDataHash)) =
  --   hashS (HLI, biParts commitInfo, consensusDataHash)
  --
  -- Note the HashTag HLI, which is not yet reflected in the Agda implementation.
  -- TODO-2: include HashTags in hash functions, consistent with the Haskell code.
  --
  -- As an aside, it is not clear whether these HashTags are necessary for all of the "inner"
  -- hashes.  They are needed to ensure that, for example, a dishonest peer cannot notice that the
  -- bits signed for a Vote happen to decode to a valid Block, and therefore take a Vote signature
  -- and use it to masquerade as a Block signture.  However, the implementation does include
  -- HashTags at each level, so we should too unless and until that changes.
