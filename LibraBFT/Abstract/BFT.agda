  -- This module provides a utility function to make it easy to
  -- provide the bft-lemma for implementations in which the
  -- participants can have different voting power.

  -- The module is parametrized with the number of participants -
  -- `authorsN`, and with a function - `votPower` - that assigns to
  -- each participant its voting power. The parameter `N` corresponds
  -- to the total voting power of all participants, as required by the
  -- parameter `totalVotPower` in the inner module. These
  -- implementations should assume a fixed unknown subset of malicious
  -- nodes - Byzantine - but should also assume a security threshold
  -- `bizF`, such that N > 3 * bizF, which should be provided in
  -- parameter `isBFT`.  Finally, the `bft-assumption` states that the
  -- combined voting power of Byzantine nodes must not exceed the
  -- security threshold `bizF`.

  -- The bft-lemma is the last lemma in this file and proves that in
  -- the intersection of any quorums, whose combined voting power is
  -- greater than or equal to `N - bizF`, there is an honest Member.
