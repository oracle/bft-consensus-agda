    -- Correctness of a pool of records is modeled by being able

    -- record using only records in the pool.

    -- The increasing round rule says that a current RecordStoreState
    -- that contains two votes from α is guaranteed to have the order of

    -- An honest participant does not vote for two different blocks in the same round.  This is
    -- "implied" by the informal Increasing Round Rule in the paper: "An honest node that voted once
    -- for B in the past may only vote for B' if round(B) < round(B′)", but it is not implied by
    -- our vOrder-based formalization thereof (above).  We therefore capture this requirement via an
    -- additional formal requirement VotesOnlyOnceRule (below).

    -- TODO: the rest of this comment really belongs somewhere else that doesn't exist yet, perhaps
    -- in the Rules module I intend to introduce soon.
    -- For the abstract model, we need this property only between pairs of votes that are in the
    -- pool.  However, for the concrete model to provide proof that the rule is followed to the
    -- abstract model, we will need to state the rule more generally.  We need the property to hold
    -- for all pairs of votes that are signed and sent by an author.  It is tempting to drop the
    -- "and sent" constraint, which rules out the possibility that an honest author could sign *but
    -- not send* contradictory votes for the same round.  This might seem unimportant, but it places
    -- an unncessary constraint on implementations.  For example, one might attempt to optimize an
    -- implementation by initiating signing in one thread while validating conditions in another.
    -- In this case, an honest author might sign a Vote, then decide not to send it, and later sign
    -- a different vote that conflicts with it.

    -- Another important predicate of a "valid" RecordStoreState is the fact
    -- that α's n-th vote is always the same.

    -- TOEXPLAIN: prevRound is defined for blocks only on the paper; however,
    --            it is cumbersome to open rc' to expose the block that comes
    --            before (Q q'). Yet, (Q q') is valid so said block has the same round,
    --            so, the prevRound (Q q') is the prevRound of the block preceding (Q q').
