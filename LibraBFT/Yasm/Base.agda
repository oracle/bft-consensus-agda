    Msg       : Set
    Part      : Set -- Types of interest that can be represented in Msgs

    -- The messages must be able to carry signatures
    instance Part-sig : WithSig Part

    -- A relation specifying what Parts are included in a Msg.
    _⊂Msg_       : Part → Msg → Set

    -- Finally, messages must carry an epoch id and might have an author
    part-epoch  : Part → EpochId

    -- Initializes a potentially-empty state with an EpochConfig
    init : PeerId → EpochConfig → Maybe PeerState → PeerState × List Msg

    -- Handles a message on a previously initialized peer.
    handle : PeerId → Msg → PeerState → PeerState × List Msg

    -- TODO-3?: So far, handlers only produce messages to be sent.
    -- It would be reasonable to generalize this to something like
    --
    --   data Action = Send Msg | Crash CrashMsg | Log LogMsg | ...
    --
    -- on the system level, and have the handlers return List Action,
    -- rather than just ListMsg.  For example, if an assertion fires, this
    -- could "kill the process" and make it not send any messages in the future.
    -- We could also then prove that the handlers do not crash, certain
    -- messages are logged under certain circumstances, etc.
    --
    -- Alternatively, we could keep this outside the system model by
    -- defining an application-specific peerState type, for example:
    --
    -- > libraHandle : Msg → Status × Log × LState → Status × LState × List Action
    -- > libraHandle _ (Crashed , l , s) = Crashed , s , [] -- i.e., crashed peers never send messages
    -- >
    -- > handle = filter isSend ∘ libraHandle

 -- We also require a standard key-value store interface, along with its
 -- functionality and various properties about it.  Most of the properties
 -- are not currently used, but they are included here based on our
 -- experience in other work, as we think many of them will be needed when
 -- reasoning about an actual LibraBFT implementation.

 -- Although we believe the assumptions here are reasonable, it is always
 -- possible that we made a mistake in postulating one of the properties,
 -- making it impossible to implement.  Thus, it would a useful contribution
 -- to:
 --
 -- TODO-1: construct an actual implementation and provide and prove the
 -- necessary properties to satisfy the requirements of this module
 --
 -- Note that this would require some work, but should be relatively
 -- straightforward and requires only "local" changes.
