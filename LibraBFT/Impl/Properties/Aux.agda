-- In this module, we will prove a structural property that any new signed message produced by an
-- honest handler from a reachable state correctly identifies the sender, and is for a valid epoch
-- of which that sender is a member.  It is postulated for now, because the property does not yet
-- hold for our fake implementation that does not actually comply.  A proof outline and notes are
-- included below, which we can finish once we do have a compliant implementation.
